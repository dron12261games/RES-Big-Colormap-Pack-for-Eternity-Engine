# Big COLORMAP pack for Eternity Engine by DRON12261

# STATUS: âœ…RELEASED

There are 56 colormaps for smooth gradient color lighting (total of 7 colors in 8 degrees of color overlay), there are 30 colormaps for fog in different colors, and 4 additional colormaps for noir or contrasting black and white.

To apply a colormap in Eternity Engine UDMF to a particular sector, you must open the custom properties of that sector and type the name of the desired colormap in the colormapmid field.

The degree of fog in a sector depends on the brightness of the sector - the darker the sector, the stronger the fog is.

To prevent colored lighting from being applied to the sky, a skybox must be used.

PLAYPAL and basic COLORMAP from Vanilla+ mod by WorldMachine, but it applies to vanilla colormap too, it just looks better with this.
